Welcome!

So your working on this eh? are you doing anywork or letting Sinan do it all?

Anyways...

This is how you get started.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 3 majors things happing.

Server.js is the MAIN api this is where the majority of the backend is happening. Then in the directory 'client' all the frontend is happening, it is using ReactJS. A flask server is also running for the AI.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to get statered you need to donwload NodeJS from here https://nodejs.org/en/

after this open your CLI program (CMD or Bash) `cd` into the directory you have your project saved in and do `npm i`

when you finish that `cd` into 'client' and do `npm i` again.

You will need to download python to code the AI if you are working on that.

To download python go here https://www.python.org/ download python 3.6+ since it is most compatible. 

After that you need to `cd` back into the parent directory and do `pip install flask`.

Now you have all the dependices downloaded.

Do `npm run dev` and all the servers should go up.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 NodeJS is in port 5000
 
 Python is in port 4000
 
 ReactJS is in port 3000
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

after that open your IDE and code away!

Thanks for the help!
