Welcome!

So your working on this eh? are you doing anywork or letting Sinan do it all?

Anyways...

This is how you get started.

There are 3 majors things happing.

Server.js is the MAIN api this is where the majority of the backend is happening. Then in the directory 'client' all the frontend is happening, it is using ReactJS.

to get statered you need to donwload NodeJS from here https://nodejs.org/en/

after this open your CLI program (CMD or Bash) `cd` into the directory you have your project saved in and do `npm i`

when you finish that `cd` into 'client' and do `npm i` again.

Now you have all the dependices downloaded.

Now `cd` back into the parent directory and do `npm run dev`.

after that open your IDE and code away!
